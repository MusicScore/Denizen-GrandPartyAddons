## GriefPrevention Expansion
Expands on GriefPrevention with new commands and permissions.
- Allow users to give each other claim blocks, with an optional quota restriction per time period (defaults to 500 per week)
- Allow users to transfer claim ownership to another user, if the other user has enough free claim blocks to claim it
