## Nether Cult
Let's get rid of those boring Nether Portals and instead make rituals!
- Replace Nether Portals with ritualistic structures
- Require certain procedures to open a portal to the Nether
- Allow free passage from Nether to world, but not from world to Nether?

## World Events
Adds new world events (not Spigot API events!), such as Blood Moons.
- Adds 4 new potions (each with their 3 variants)
- Adds 6 randomly triggered events (and possibly more)

**Work on this will be temporarily discontinued.**

## Portal Catalyst
Teleportation items. How quaint.
- Give support for [Nether Cult](#nether-cult) by adding a special teleportation item for returning from the Nether to the portal in the overworld
- Basic teleportation item stuff
- Include "personal" teleportation items (react as Essentials /sethome and /home)
- Add support for other teleportation plugins?

## Item Stats Modifiers
Creates items that modify the player's stats.
- Support an infinite number of modifiers (requires scripting knowledge)
- Use of YAML files and recursive file loading to dynamically load all items
- Make it so generic that any scripter can expand on it
