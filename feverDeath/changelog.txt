  = Known issues
    - [N/A] Script still doesn't really know what optimization is. There *may*
            be a noticeable delay between when the script activates and when
            the player is affected by the script.

  + Greater optimization
    + Scripts do not run as many commands if features are disabled
  + Better error checking
  + Afterlife's custom drop mechanics revised
    + Only drops 25% of the player's lost EXP OR 300 EXP, whichever is less
    + Only reduces hotbar items' chance of being lost by 20% instead of 50%
  + If you're missing a file/script, you can't use the addon

  = Known issues
    - [N/A] This addon doesn't know what optimization is. It might slow the
            server along with it.
    - [N/A] Badly scripted, and written without ever testing it out until the
            last second.
