# This script does not require "gpa_gpu_main.yml" to work.
# 
# 
# ----| ABOUT THIS SCRIPT
# 
# This script simply returns a value representing the Minecraft version your
# server is running.
# 
# This script is NOT dynamic. If you have a version that is between 1.8.8 and
# the latest version and this script returns an incorrect value, PLEASE contact
# MusicInsane on GitHub. Feel free to edit this script to add in values that
# you need, but it would be appreciated if you made an issue or pull request on
# the GrandPartyAddons GitHub regarding support of certain versions.
# 
# 
# ----| HOW TO USE
# 
# Simply use the tag
#   - <proc[gpa_gpu_versionCheck]>
# 
# This tag will automatically return a value based on the Spigot version you're
# running. The values are as follows:
#   - -1  : A version of Spigot unsupported by the latest Denizen Developmental
#           build or is not detected by this script.
#   - 0   : 1.8.8 (only the final Spigot build!)
#   - 1   : 1.9
#   - 2   : 1.9.2 to 1.9.4
#   - 3   : 1.10 to 1.10.2
#   - 4   : 1.11
#   - 5   : 1.11.1 to 1.11.2
#   - 6   : 1.12 to 1.12.2
# 
# 
# ----| NOTES
# 
# The only reason why this script is not dynamic is because some Minecraft
# updates have changes that causes it to be incompatible with the previous
# update (for example, 1.11.1 adds Iron Nuggets while 1.11 does not have that
# item). It's not possible to write a script that accurately predicts exactly
# which Minecraft versions have incompatible features with previous versions.
