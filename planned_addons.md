# Planned Addons
A list of planned addons that will be added to this repository.
## Table of Contents
1. [Advanced Lights](#advanced-lights)
2. [Nether Cult](#nether-cult)
3. [Portal Catalyst](#portal-catalyst)
4. [GrandRPG](#grandrpg)
## Advanced Lights
Add more light sources using custom player heads. Most player heads will come from [Freshcoal Heads](https://heads.freshcoal.com/maincollection.php), and other sources which will be given proper credit.
- Candles and lanterns confirmed
- Possible heads: *mini-glowstone, lava*
- Perhaps add furniture-type light sources?
- Possibly include custom crafting recipes, though support for this may have to be through a third-party plugin.

## Nether Cult
Let's get rid of those boring Nether Portals and instead make rituals!
- Replace Nether Portals with ritualistic structures
- Require certain procedures to open a portal to the Nether
- Allow free passage from Nether to world, but not from world to Nether?

## Portal Catalyst
Teleportation items. How quaint.
- Give support for [Nether Cult](#nether-cult) by adding a special teleportation item for returning from the Nether to the portal in the overworld
- Basic teleportation item stuff.
- Include "personal" teleportation items (react as Essentials /sethome and /home)
- Add support for other teleportation plugins?
